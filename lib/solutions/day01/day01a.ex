# An easy first day, and the kind of problem that can be solved very elegantly in
# Elixir. We first parse the lines into two separate lists â€“ Enum.unzip/1 is very
# useful here â€“ then sort them and zip them back up, this time computing the sum
# of the absolute difference of each pair. At around six milliseconds it isn't
# particularly fast, but based on some superficial profiling most of this time
# comes from the String.split/1 call, which we can't easily avoid.
