# This was probably the fastest I've solved a second part of an AoC question.
# Since the array returned by the recursive function of the first part can
# contain duplicates â€“ one duplicate peak for each path to that peak â€“ all
# we have to do for the second part is remove the line that eliminates these
# duplicates, thus giving us the requested number of paths to any peak from
# each starting position. I originally planned to use a set instead of a list
# during recursion, i.e. get rid of duplicate peaks as we're recursing, but
# I found that eliminating duplicates afterwards was fast enough, and by
# coincidence this approach made the second part very easy.
